# 🔓 Registration Enabled for Development

## ✅ Changes Made

I have successfully enabled the `/register` endpoint for development by removing the following restrictions:

### 1. **Navbar Registration Button** (`components/ui/navbar.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
disabled={true}  // Registration button was disabled
```
**After:**
```tsx
disabled={false}  // Registration button is now enabled
```

### 2. **Hero Registration Button** (`components/landing/Hero.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
disabled={true}
>
  Registrations opening on 15th August  // Showed opening date
```
**After:**
```tsx
disabled={false}
>
  Register Now  // Shows active registration text
```

### 3. **Middleware Redirect** (`middleware.ts`) - **CRITICAL FIX**
**Before:**
```tsx
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname === '/register') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url))  // Redirected to homepage
  }
}
```
**After:**
```tsx
export function middleware() {
  // Registration is now open for development
  // Removed redirect from /register to allow access
  return NextResponse.next()  // Allows access to /register
}
```

## 🎯 **Result:**

- ✅ **Desktop Registration Button**: Now clickable in the navigation bar
- ✅ **Hero Registration Button**: Now shows "Register Now" instead of "Registrations opening on 15th August"
- ✅ **Mobile Registration Button**: Was already working (no changes needed)
- ✅ **Middleware Redirect**: Removed automatic redirect from `/register` to homepage
- ✅ **Registration Form**: Fully functional at `/register` endpoint

## 🚀 **Development Server:**

The application is running on:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3001 (port 3001 because 3000 was in use)
- **Network**: http://192.168.56.1:3001

## 📝 **Note:**

The registration functionality was restricted in **three places**:
1. UI button disabled states (fixed)
2. **Middleware redirect** (fixed - this was the main issue causing homepage redirects)
3. Registration date messaging (fixed)

The **middleware redirect** was the primary cause of `/register` redirecting to the homepage. All restrictions have been removed for development purposes.

The registration form and all API endpoints are now fully accessible for testing and development! 🎉
